# My blog / home page 

## How to use:
1. Write a org document *somewhere*
2. Use `epos/blog-publish` in emacs to export the org document as HTML to `~/Blog/`
3. After building the project you can use `just build` and `just run` to proofread the generated HTML.
4. After this `just publish` can be used to push the new generated articles to github.
5. Now the articles should be availible on the [blog](https://epos95.github.io/)
